# ‚ö†Ô∏è Zysculpt Has Moved!

This repository has moved to a new home:  
**https://github.com/zysculptlabs/zysculptlabs.github.io**

## What is Zysculpt?

Zysculpt is an open-source career assistant that helps you:
- Shorten your job application time
- Power up your skillset
- Streamline your job search process

## Why Did We Move?

It‚Äôs a bit of a long story, but essentially, we lost access to our original GitHub account. We had two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled, but unfortunately, we lost access to the devices tied to the account and, at the same time, lost both the recovery codes and access to the authenticator app that had been set up. With no way to verify our identity or recover the account, we had no choice but to start fresh under a new account.

## How to Access the New Site

1. You should be automatically redirected to the new URL
2. If not, please visit: [https://zysculptlabs.github.io](https://zysculptlabs.github.io)
